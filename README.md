# 🌌 Imperfect-Siamese-Baryogenesis-Phase-Desynchronization - Explore the Universe's Hidden Secrets

![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v1.0-blue)

## 📖 Overview

Imperfect-Siamese-Baryogenesis-Phase-Desynchronization allows you to test a unique twin-universe framework. It explores how a slight phase desynchronization of about 5% between Siamese universes creates the observed difference between matter and antimatter. This application provides numerical scans, tests of cosmic background radiation (CMB) and fast radio bursts (FRB), as well as scripts for reproducible data analysis.
